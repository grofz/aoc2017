Solving Advent of Code 2017 in Fortran

1. Inverse Captcha
    - sum numbers in a 1D array
2. Corruption Checksum
    - find largest and smallest number
    - find two numbers that are divisible
3. Spiral Memory
    - simulate going in circles in 2D array
4. High=Entropy Passphrases
    - find duplicate words
    - find anagrams
5. A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike
    - jump inside an array of integers and modify them
6. Memory Reallocation
    - evolve state, detect when state repeats
    - using red-black tree to store the states
7. Recursive Circus
    - using recursion to find unbalanced sub-tower
8. I Heard You Like Registers
    - implement register operations
    - using red-black tree to store the register names
9. Stream Processiong
    - parse nested groups and garbage
10. Knot Hash
    - implment knot hash algorithm
11. Hex Ed
    - calculate moving distance within a hexagonal grid
12. Digital Plumber
    - label connected groups (using a recursive flood-fill)
13. Packet Scanners
    - simulate passing of a packet through firewall
14. Disk Defragmentation
    - use knot hash from Day 10
    - label connected groups
15. Dueling Generators
    - generate sequence of numbers and compare their bit values
    - using "btest" and other bit manipulation procedures
16. Permutation Promenade
    - simulate operations with a string (swaps, shifts)
    - repeat for an astronomical number of times in Part 2
    - then evaluate the repeating pattern
17. Spinlock
    - circular buffer
18. Duet
    - implement code interpreter, run two instances sending/receiving values between them
    - using queue implementation
19. Series of Tubes
    - walk along lines, turn left/right at corners, record all letters along the path
20. Particle Swarm
    - position, velocity and acceleration of particles
    - determine collisions
    - just guessed when stop the simulation
21. Fractal Art
    TODO
22. Sporifica Virus
    TODO
23. Coprocessor Conflagration
    - decrypt what the code does (primary test)
